<p align="left">Why you always in a mood?<br>
Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new<br>
I ain't tryna tell you what to do<br>
But try to play it cool<br>
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules<br>
Everything look better with a view</p>

<p align="center">I could never get attached<br>
When I start to feel, I unattach<br>
Somehow always end up feeling bad<br>
Baby, I am not your dad<br>
It's not all you want from me<br>
I just want your company</p>

<p align="center">Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room<br>
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused<br>
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood<br>
Now we arguin' in my bedroom<br>
We play games of love to avoid the depression<br>
We been here before, and I won't be your victim</p>

<p align="right">So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular?<br>
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular<br>
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up<br<
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough</p>

<p align="right">I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' Fourties<br>
You keep playin', not another day with you shorty<br>
Mismatch, bitch, that was way before you know me<br>
Got a lot of love, well you better save it for me<br>
We play games of love to avoid the depression<br>
We been here before, and I won't be your victim</p>
