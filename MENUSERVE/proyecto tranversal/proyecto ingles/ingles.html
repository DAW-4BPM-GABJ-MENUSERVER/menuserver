        <p class="info2">The overcrowding of houses in Tijuana<br>
            can lead to looking for more land for<br>
            build them but since there is no more space<br>

            <img src="" id="foto1"></p>
            <p class="info1">In this project we will create a house<br>
                ecological, with recycled materials<br>
                in order to help the environment.<br>
                An ecological house is one that achieves<br>
                optimal habitability conditions<br>
                with minimal energy consumption, having<br>

        Starting from “Rural Schools” the idea of ​​adopting the project to create<br>
        ecological houses with which families who currently live in a deplorable way can benefit <br>due to the lack of economic resources that prevent them from obtaining decent housing since<br> for this we would simply need the natural resources that we can expropriate from the specific place in which it would be carried<br> out. said action. For the reasons mentioned above, an ecological house design will be studied which would have the purpose<br> of improving the quality of life and at the same time being friendly to the environment.</p>
    <p class="info8">
    There are great challenges and one of the main ones <br>pis to ensure that at least the <br>majority of families have access to decent housing and in optimal conditions. For the community in the <br>urban sector, due to its constant process and opportunities, it is easier for them<br> to obtain a home in extremely good conditions. optimal for living with dignity, otherwise for the rural sector <br>where economic marginalization is the main factor why families cannot obtain their own home.</p>
